In a recent contribution [2] Li et al. estimate that 86% of infections remain undetected; in other words only about 1/7 of the infections are detected and can thus be isolated. More recently, other studies have suggested that the fractions of undetected infections could be even higher [3, 4].” (Gaeta 2020:1)“The goal of this note is two-fold: on the ne hand we want to develop a simple general model to take into account the presence of asymptomatic infectives; on the other hand, we want to apply this to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic,in particular considering the situation in Italy.” (Gaeta 2020:1)“he substantially long time these spend being infective and not isolated; this is called A-SIR, the A standing indeed for asymptomatic” (Gaeta 2020:1)“main interests is in understanding how relevant it can be to uncover asymptomatic infectives and promptly isolate them; we then study (numerically) how the dynamics is affected by a reduction of the infective time-span for this class” (Gaeta 2020:2)“ull time simulations of the model; these are not so significant, as the effective parameters of the model are and will continue to be changing due to containment measures and public awareness, but this allows us to get an estimate on what would be the epidemic peak and the time span of the epidemic of no actions were taken” (Gaeta 2020:2)“the model suggests that (if no actions were taken) an overwhelming part of the population will have been in contact with the virus - most of them with no or very little symptoms - so that if permanent immunity is gained by the immune system of infected, and the virus does not mutate too quickly, one would be confident that there will be no second run of COVID in next year” (Gaeta 2020:2)“restrictive measures are taken into account by a “reduction factor”, and discuss on the one hand how a prompt isolation of asymptomatic infectives would change the dynamics in this framework, and on the other what the time-scale could be in this context” (Gaeta 2020:2)“We will end the paper by a discussion of some relevant general points and by conclusions; we anticipate here the main ones: (i) there is a marked difference between the standard SIR dynamics and the dynamics of the A-SIR model, i.e. the one taking into account the presence of a large class of asymptomatic infectives; (ii) in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, assuming a ratio of symptomatic to total infections of ξ = 1/10 yields a good agreement between the model and epidemiological data.” (Gaeta 2020:2)“first face a new virus we only know, by definition, the early phase of the dynamics, so parameters should be extracted from such data. (We stress that the parameters depend not only on the pathogen agent, but also on the social structure and organization of the country (e.g. on its population density, restrictive measures, and sanitary system); thus they are different in each country.) We will thus concentrate on this initial phase, with I (t) and R(t) rather small, and try to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the dynamics; the purpose will be to estimate the parameters α and β - and thus also the epidemic threshold γ - in this case” (Gaeta 2020:5)“large fraction of infected people are actually asymptomatic, but still fully infective, as it appears to be the case for COVID-19” (Gaeta 2020:9)“he presence of a large population of asymptomatic infectives” (Gaeta 2020:9)“(i) On the one hand, they are a formidable vehicle of contagion, as they have no reason to take special precautions, and get in contact with a number of people which themselves do not take the due precautions (which would be taken in the case of an individual with evident symptoms);” (Gaeta 2020:9)“(ii) On the other hand, assuming once the infection is ceased they have acquired permanent immunity, they contribute to group immunity reached once the population of susceptibles falls below the epidemic threshold.” (Gaeta 2020:9)“infective people are either symptomatic or asymptomatic. A more refined subdivision of their state would be more realistic” (Gaeta 2020:10)“assume permanent immunity of individuals who have been infected and recovered, and constant population” (Gaeta 2020:10)“We will have susceptibles S (t) in a unique class, but two classes of infected and infective people: symptomatic I (t) and asymptomatic J (t); and similarly two classes of removed people: registered removed R(t) and unregistered removed (those who were passing unnoticed through the infection) U (t)” (Gaeta 2020:10)“In the case of COVID-19, it is known that the incubation time is about 5.1 days; assuming that symptomatic infection is promptly recognized and swiftly treated, epidemiological and clinical data suggest the approximate values (note that asymptomatic removal time η−1 includes both the incubation time and the healing time) β −1 ≃ 5 − 7, η−1 ≃ 14 − 21 for the removal and recovery rates; the value of ξ is more controversial, as mentioned in the Introduction” (Gaeta 2020:11)RefG.

      "content"	 : "      Table of Contents  Introduction  Solving Differential Equations  Ref    IntroductionThe simplest model and the foundation of many other models is the SIR model.  S: Suseptible  I: Infectious  R: RecoveredNote that R can be either people that have recovered from the disease or also people that have died.  This model does not differentiate the two states but later on we can look at how we can extend this model using the SIRm model where m incorporates the people that have passed away.You can think of these models as a network model where each node consists of the compartments and the edges from each node corresponds to a rate in which activity from one node to other occurs.  These variables (S, I, and R) represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. To represent that the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals may vary over time (even if the total population size remains constant), we make the precise numbers a function of t (time): S(t), I(t) and R(t).$beta$ is the rate at which S becomes I and $gamma$ is the rate at which I becomes R.graph LR    S--&amp;gt;|beta|I    I--&amp;gt;|gamma|R    ODE --&amp;gt; Parameter     Parameter  --&amp;gt; Model    Model --&amp;gt; PredictionAs implied by the variable function of t, the model is dynamic in that the numbers in each compartment may fluctuate over time. During an epidemic, the number of susceptible individuals falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and recovered compartments. The disease cannot break out again until the number of susceptibles has built back up, e.g. as a result of offspring being born into the susceptible compartment.Solving Differential EquationsNOTE: I will only do this once as all differential equations are solved the same way.Recall:The model is defined as:Note that we normalize everything by the population.Next we take the partial derivative of this equation wrt to time, and it will give us 3 rates of change.There are several key observations we can take from this:  The rate at which the number of suspected people decrease because of the rate of infection.  As time progresses there is a small amount of people in the population that can be infected.  The rate at which the number of infected people increase due to the previous term and decrease based on the number of recovered people.There is no analytical solution for this so simulations are run.One way to use this model is to estimate the hyper-parameters, in this case $beta$ and $gamma$, based on real world data I and then simulate to identify S and R respectively.  This will also enable us to do some forecasting because after all parameters have been identified you only have to integrate across time.This will be our strategy for implementation.  This will be a good time to practice optimization techniques to reduce some cost function.  Basically to identify the parameters we need to reduce some cost funtion such that $hat{y}$ is as close to $y$ as possible.  See the flowchart above.RefW. O. Kermack and A. G.

      "content"	 : "IntroductionTypically, infectious diseases are mathematically characterized by using  compartmental models.  These models divide the population in compartments, with varying assumptions on each individual as being in various compartments having the same characteristics.  These models are often investigated through the use of ordinary differential equations, but can also be viewed in a stochastic framework, which are more akin to the real world but are often harder to analyze.These models can help us predict properties of the disease as it spreads, giving us vital information regarding the prevalence and duration of the epidemic.  Furthermore, by varying hyper-parameters of the model we can simulate various outcomes of the state of the epidemic to determine the most effective course of actions.  For instance, some models may take into account equipments such as ICU and vaccines to identify places of aid in the healthcare system.This project is by no means an exhaustive literature review of the different types of models but it does shed light on variuos techniques that are currently being used.  In the project I will use these models as a way of tracking the COVID-19 pandemic.This is in order of implementation as well as my literature review is as follows:  SIR  SAIR  SDIR  SIGR  SEIR",
